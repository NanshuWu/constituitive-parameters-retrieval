# constituitive-parameters-retrieval

This is a set of scripts for retrieving constituitive parameters (e.g. relative permeability and permittivity), in the rectangular waveguide system, from measured S parameters. Three are three algorithms named NRW, NNI, and NIST, whose pros and cons are listed below to help choose a suitable algorithm for different samples.
